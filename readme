# Hello There!

I'm Jose Luis Garcia Linares and this is the solution to the task Coding Task â€“ Data Feed.

## Goal

We would like to see a command-line program that should process a local XML file (feed.xml)
and push the data of that XML file to a DB of your choice (e.g., SQLite)
You are free to use any library or framework you need or feel comfortable with. You have a
free choice of tools. Please use PHP!

## Specifications

1. The program should be easily extendable, e.g., we could use different data storage to
read data from or to push data to. This should be configurable.
2. Errors should be written to a logfile
3. The application should be tested.

It was a very interesting task, and I enjoyed quite a bit doing it. I made it so that its possible to take
the xml file to either a SQLite database or a MySql one with options from the terminal, also being able to take the
data from a csv file. The database from SQLite is created in the path written in config.ini

All errors should go into the logs/error.log file. And there's also a test file for the Processor.php file with some cases.
As Libraries I've used phpunit/phpunit for the test, and league/csv for the reading of a csv text file.

For any questions or doubts, please don't hesitate to contact me at jlgarlinares@gmail.com
